      "comment": "An app has three key components:\n\n  * `model` &mdash; a big chunk of data fully describing your application.\n\n  * `view` &mdash; a way to show your model on screen. It takes in two\n    arguments. One is the model, which contains *all* the information about our\n    app. The other is an [`Address`][address] that helps us handle user input.\n    Whenever there is a click or key press, we send a message to the address\n    describing what happened and where.\n\n  * `update` &mdash; a function to update your model. Whenever a UI event\n    occurs, is routed through the `Address` to this update function. We take\n    in the message and the current model, then we give back a new model!\n\n[The Elm Architecture][arch] augments this basic pattern to give you all the\nmodularity you want. But since we have whole model in one place makes, it is\nalso really easy to support features like *save* and *undo* that can be quite\nhard in other languages.\n\n[address]: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/2.0.1/Signal#Mailbox\n[arch]: https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/",
