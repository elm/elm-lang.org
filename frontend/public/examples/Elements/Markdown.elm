# Markdown Support

Elm has native markdown support, making it easy to create complex
text elements. You can easily make:

  - Headers
  - [Links](/)
  - Images
  - **Bold**, *italic*, and `monospaced` text
  - Lists (numbered, nested, multi-paragraph bullets)

It all feels quite natural to type. For more information on Markdown,
see [this site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
